            <p>Most of the repos you'll find here were projects for the 10-part <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1">Data Science Specialization</a> through Coursera and Johns Hopkins University.</p>
            <p>It was a fantastic set of courses that I'd highly recommend. Most of the repos here won't make much sense out of context, so visit coursera directly instead.</p>

            <h3>Moon Lander with Bombs</h3>
            <p>Last year I was on a pygame kick and decided to create a little <a href="https://github.com/kevinandrewbishop/lander_space_invader"> Moon Lander game</a>. The moon has a randomly generated jagged surface and you can only land properly in areas that are flat enough. You've also got to land pretty softly or you'll crash.</p>
            <p>Honestly it was pretty boring. So I decided to add moon bases with missile silos that fire at the lander. I also equipped the lander with bombs. The task now is to destroy as many silos as possible and land safely before running out of fuel. Much more fun!</p>
            <p>This is written in python, not javascript, so you can't play in your browser. But if you've got python and pygame, just fork the repo and have fun!</p>
<p>Once you're finished with that, if you're really depserate try this <a href = "hangman.html">Hangman</a> game that I made to help me learn javascript/jquery.</p>

            <h3>Start your own Github page</h3>
            <p>If you want a github page that looks more like a normal website click <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. It's a fun way to build a little page and gives you more control over your github page.</p>
